[00:13.94] Today ain't been a good day, my traphouse just took a raid
[00:17.23] My darg catch M's don't tat' their face
[00:19.22] More platinum plaques on the way
[00:20.89] Heard London niggas ain't got guns, like I ain't got a mini AK
[00:24.67] Like I ain't givin' models cocaine, like I ain't put an M in my safe
[00:28.14] We out in Paris, this drip make a rapper embarrassed
[00:30.26] I know niggas sicko, like, "ew"
[00:32.35] Just got out of a deal
[00:33.64] Only 20-some wit all these mills
[00:35.00] All of these thotties, all over my body
[00:37.16] I made it a hobby, I love me a kill
[00:39.41] Bitches love me, I'm him, I ain't flaugin', this shit is for real
[00:42.57] Think I'm lackin', you pickle-head dill
[00:43.94] Not gon' speak on no action, that's 'posed to be concelead
[00:46.09] Before this rappin' we was up in the fields

[00:54.36] I'm tired of these niggas, pretendin' to me to be real
[00:56.97] Send a bitch to go and do the coke deal
[00:58.75] Young rich nigga I ain't signed me no deal
[01:00.81] Lambo', double-R, movin' ghost still
[01:02.57] Show the trenches that we all got hope still
[01:04.62] We got to find a way, crack in the microwave
[01:08.10] Take a couple thousand, go get your nails done and go get microbladed
[01:11.74] My nigga got life, we cry
[01:13.22] And he ain't beat the case, we tried
[01:15.37] Mummy wipe them tears out your eyes
[01:16.99] 5 A.M in Paris, what a life
[01:18.91] We got to find a way, crack in the microwave
[01:22.62] I put the call in, bet by the mornin' that someone dying today
[01:26.02] Youngins' hoppin' out, masked up
[01:27.42] I won't ever Diddy, you can ask Puff
[01:29.21] Actin' like a hood nigga
[01:30.29] They don't even know the opportunities I passed up
[01:32.86] Big doinks in the air, gassed up
[01:34.56] Such-and-such died, he got blast up
[01:36.35] Know my mama hurtin', she gon' sit inside
[01:38.01] How she really feel, I won't ask her
[01:40.28] Flexed up but I made it, 'fore I came in both them bitches ate it
[01:43.42] Life I'm livin', course a nigga cocky
[01:44.92] Bitch, can no one stop me, I'm the people favorite
[01:47.55] We got to find a way, crack in the microwave
[01:51.24] Take a couple thousand, go get your nails done and go get microbladed
[01:54.42] Today ain't been a good day, my traphouse just took a raid
[01:57.36] My darg catch M's, don't tat' their face
[01:59.58] More platinum plaques on the way
[02:01.33] Heard London niggas ain't got guns, like I ain't got a mini AK
[02:04.97] Like I ain't givin' models cocaine, like I ain't put an M in my safe
[02:08.35] We out in Paris, this drip make a rapper embarrassed
[02:10.60] I know niggas sicko, like, "ew"
[02:12.52] Just got out of a deal

[02:15.68] All of these thotties, all over my body
[02:17.25] I made it a hobby, I love me a kill
[02:19.57] Bitches love me, I'm him, I ain't flaugin', this shit is for real
[02:23.21] If I fuck with a bitch, then I'm flyin' her in
[02:26.17] Yeah, she shoppin' online, and I ain't surprised
[02:28.93] She probably just buyin' Skims (yeah)
[02:30.61] She ain't even know that I hit the corner to buy her designer things
[02:34.08] My bruddas still huggin the block
[02:35.65] Even though he lit, he's gonna die in sin
[02:37.93] More money, more clips, darg
[02:39.51] Hit the brick with a wash, let it whip, darg
[02:42.15] That money was written, and now they wanna lie on a scripture
[02:44.82] Way too deep in, deep in
[02:47.68] I think I'm way too deep in, deep in
[02:51.52] Way too deep in, deep in
[02:54.96] I think I'm way too deep in, deep in
